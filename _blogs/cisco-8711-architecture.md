## Cisco 8711-32FH-M Use Cases  
### Aggregation, Core, Peering and DC Core with RON(Routed Optical Networking)       
![use-case.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/use-case.png)  

As user applications become more dynamic, differentiated user experiences are required, and network resources need to be optimized in terms of power and real estate. Cisco 8711-32FH-M has been designed to cater to the market requirement for total system bandwidth, port diversity, and MACsec encryption. These new capabilities far exceed what could be accomplished with a single P100 NPU. Specifically, Cisco 8711-32FH-M supports 12.8 Tbps of forwarding capacity, as well as 32 ports of high speed 400G, 128 ports of 100G, or 128 ports of low speed 10G or 25G.  

Moreover, Cisco’s [Converged SDN Transport Solution](https://blogs.cisco.com/sp/routed-optical-networking-its-about-the-architecture), is a simplified single layer architecture that delivers efficient network utilization, reduced network complexity, faster time-to-market, automation empowerment, and differentiated service offering. This solutions works by merging IP and Optimal onto a single layer where all the switching is done. Routers are connected with standardized [400G ZR/ZR+/Bright(0dBm) ZR+ coherent pluggable optics](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/cisco8000/Interfaces/710x/b-interfaces-config-guide-cisco8k-r710x/m-zr-zrp-cisco-8000.html). With a single service layer based upon IP, flexible management tools can leverage [telemetry](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/cisco8000/telemetry/710x/configuration/guide/b-telemetry-cg-8000-710x.html) and [model-driven programmability](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/cisco8000/programmability/710x/b-programmability-cg-8000-710x.html) to streamline lifecycle operations.  

### Secure High-speed Data Center/Cloud interconnect and large Regional Hub/Branch router    
![Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 5.08.50 PM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 5.08.50 PM.png)  

Securing the connections of multiple data centers and cloud environments typically involves meeting the highest levels of bandwidth requirements on a smaller number of links. WAN MACsec, sometimes called data center interconnect (DCI), is the ideal encryption solution for such settings.    

Backhauling remote branch sites is critical to the success of many commercial, enterprise, and government organizations. In the consumer space, backhauling is important for remote stores and point-of-sale kiosks. In the government space, it is crucial for the operation of remote agencies and offices.

## System Details   

### System Block Diagram   

Cisco 8711-32FH-M has one common CPU complex board, P100 NPU, 2 Power Supply Units (PSU) with support of 1+1 redundancy, and 6 Fan Trays (FT) with support of 1 Fan Failure condition. All PSUs and FTs are field replaceable units (FRUs).    

![Screenshot 2024-12-22 at 1.08.04 PM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-22 at 1.08.04 PM.png)

P100 is a family of high-capacity packet switching devices. P100 consists of 6 slices. Each slice has a “receive” and a “transmit” part, respectively the Rx and Tx slices. Each slice supports two groups of interfaces (i.e., a pair of IFGs). Performance wise, each slice handles up to one packet per clock and has a data bandwidth of up to 3.2 Tbps. The total capacity of a P100 device is determined by the number of slices. Cisco 8711-32FH-M uses four slices and archieve up to 5.047 Bpps forwarding performance per system.    

Cisco Silicon One P100 features:  
- 19.2 Tbps full-duplex and 8.1 Bpps Forwarding Capacity NPU  
  - 192x 100G SerDes with each capable of operating at 10G/25G/50G/100G using NRZ or PAM4 modulation  
  - Flexible port configuration supporting 10/25/40/50/100/200/400/800 Gbps  
  - 72 MB fully shared on-die packet buffer  
- Expandable in-package packet buffer using 8 GB HBM  
- On-chip, high-performance, P4-programmable host NPU for high-bandwidth offline packet processing  
- Multiple embedded processors for CPU offloading  
- 64K VoQ (Virtual Output Queue) for Network slice and 16K VoQ for Fabric slice  
- Dedicated 132 Counters banks (1M counters) and built-in counters in HCAM(Hash-based TCAM)  
- 6M IPv4 or 3M IPv6 FIB qualified scale without compression (Hardware capable much more)

### Front Panel Port Combination Configurations  

Cisco 8711-32FH-M can support several interface combinations.  

**Notes**: For more information on even and odd port numbers, see the Port Numbering section above.      
{: .notice}   

The first configuration is 32x Grey 400 GbE QSFP56-DD. In this configuration, the QSFPDD ports are populated with 400G Grey optics. This is the default mode with no manual configuration.    

![Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.05.33 PM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.05.33 PM.png)  

The second configuration is 32x Grey 100 GbE QSFP. In this configuration, the QSFPDD ports are populated with 100G optics and the QSFP28 ports are populated with 100G optics. There is no manual configuration.    

![Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.07.53 PM.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.07.53 PM.jpg)  

The third configuration is 400G DCO (Digital Coherent Optic). In this configuration, the even ports (i.e., top row) are populated with 400G DCO optics (e.g., 400G ZR/ZR+/Bright ZR+).   

![Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.10.15 PM.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.10.15 PM.jpg)  

**Notes**: Lower row qualification pending lab certification  
{: .notice}   

The fourth configuration is a combination of 400G DCO (Digital Coherent Optic) and Grey 400G optics. In this configuration, the even ports are populated with 400G DCO optics (ZR/ZR+/Bright ZR+), and the odd ports (i.e., bottom row) are populated with 400G Grey optics.    

![Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.12.19 PM.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.12.19 PM.jpg)  

The fifth configuration is 16x Grey 800G Grey Optics (QDD 2X400G FR4 or QDD 8X100G FR). In this configuration, the even ports are populated with 800G optics and all other odd ports are shut down automatically.    

![Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.14.00 PM.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.14.00 PM.jpg)  

The sixth configuration is a combination of Grey 800G Optics and 400G DCO (ZR/ZR+/Bright ZR+) optics. In this configuration, the number of 800G Grey and 400G DCO (ZR/ZR+/Bright ZR+) optics populating the even ports must sum to 16.   

![Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.14.54 PM.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 8.14.54 PM.jpg)  

The seventh configuration is a combination of Grey 800G Optics, 400G DCO Optics (ZR/ZR+/Bright ZR+), and Grey 400G Optics. In this configuration, the number of 800G Grey and 400G DCO optics populating even ports must sum to 16. Furthermore, for every even port with 400G DCO (ZR/ZR+/Bright ZR+), the corresponding odd port can also have Grey 400G optics.

### Packet flow in Cisco 8711-32FH-M

![Screenshot 2024-12-25 at 11.00.36 PM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-25 at 11.00.36 PM.png)     
Figure 20. Data path flow in Cisco 8711-32FH-M  
{: .text-center}   

1. Packets arrive on the input slice of the receive device    
2. The NPU performs the packet lookup, feature (example: ingress ACL) checks, and identifies the destination for the packet  
3. The ingress NPU enqueues the packet on the corresponding VoQ for the {destination, traffic class}  
4. When credits are available for the destination VoQ, the packet is switched across the SMS to the destination (egress) slice  
5. On the egress slice, the transmit direction lookups and feature (example: Egress ACL) checks are performed  
6. The final encapsulations are added to the packet and it’s transmitted from the TX NPU out the physical interface  
7. All packets are switched through the same SMS regardless of whether they are bound for the same NPU slice or a different NPU slice
