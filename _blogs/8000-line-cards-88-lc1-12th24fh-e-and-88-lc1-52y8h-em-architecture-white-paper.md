## Egress Feature Capability support on Cisco 88-LC1-12TH24FH-E and Cisco 88-LC1-52Y8H-EM Line Cards 
The Cisco 8000 P100-based line cards, specifically the Cisco 88-LC1-12TH24FH-E and Cisco 88-LC1-52Y8H-EM, offer advanced egress feature capabilities designed to enhance network performance and efficiency. These line cards support multicast traffic scheduling on egress queues, allowing for granular control over multicast traffic. This feature enables the application of egress queuing policy map parameters such as traffic shaping, priority, and queuing to each egress queue, ensuring efficient and prioritized handling of multicast data for different receivers. 

Additionally, the line cards provide egress class-level traffic shaping for subinterfaces, allowing for optimal bandwidth allocation and improved network performance. This is achieved by enabling class-level rate-limiting traffic shapers for each class in the egress subinterface-level queuing policy maps. This feature ensures that traffic flow is controlled granularly, enhancing overall network efficiency. 

Furthermore, the priority propagation on the egress queues feature ensures that high-priority traffic is consistently prioritized across multiple sub-interfaces on the same network port. This capability enhances the performance of critical applications by allowing high-priority traffic to take precedence over non-priority traffic, maintaining optimal network performance, and reducing latency for essential services such as voice and real-time video. These egress features collectively contribute to the robust and efficient operation of networks utilizing the Cisco 8000 P100-based line cards.
