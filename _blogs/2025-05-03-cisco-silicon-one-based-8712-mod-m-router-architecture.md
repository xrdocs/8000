## Introduction
The Cisco 8000 Series combines the revolutionary Cisco Silicon One™, IOS XR® software, and a set of clean sheet chassis to deliver a breakthrough in high-performance routers. 
High-performance networking systems have historically been divided into routing or switching classes, with distinct hardware and software. But, as the necessity for reliable networks proliferates, it is imperative that traditional networks shift to a new architecture to address exponential bandwidth needs, ubiquitous connectivity, security, better quality of service, low latency coupled with high reliability, availability, and serviceability of the infrastructure. The Cisco® 8000 Series portfolio completes this journey with the Cisco 8700 products.
The Cisco 8700 series is an addition to [the Cisco 8000 Series Routers](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/routers/8000-series/index.html) powered by [Cisco Silicon One](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/silicon-one/index.html)™  ASICs.  8700 products embody this cutting-edge innovation of the 8000 portfolio, offering advanced features engineered for seamless integration and scalability. Whether enhancing existing infrastructure or enabling new capabilities, the 8700 series products empower organizations to achieve their goals with unmatched efficiency and effectiveness. 

## Cisco 8712-MOD-M Overview  
Cisco 8712-MOD-M is a 2RU 6.4Tbps fixed system based on a single Cisco Silicon One™ K100 Network Processing Unkit (NPU). This system offers 4 bays of Modular Port Adaptors (MPAs) with each slot having 1.6Tbps capacity. 4 types of MPAs are supported which offers diverse port speed combinations supported by SFP56, QSF28, QSFPDD optical form factors: 1G, 10G, 25G, 50G, 100G, 400G.

### Service Provider(SP) networking Architecture shift


Lets look at traditional SP network architecture and the how it is transitioning to nextGen network driven by Agile Services Networking architecture.

Network roles are strictly defined and deployed in networks. Devices must be groomed specifically to address different roles in network. And feature capability , scale and bandwidth requirements are differently fitted to address different needs in the network.

Common view of traditional service provider network is as following, different services like business, wireless, mobile etc. are terminated into the transport aggregation which includes further nailing down to access, preaggregation and aggregation network segments etc.. Aggregated transport networks talk to Edge then merge into the  Core segment. Edge can segregated to cater to different use cases as per the specific need of each categories like, Business edge, Mobile edge, Wireless edge etc..or all types of edge services can be centrally placed and provisioned.


## Cisco 8712-MOD-M Use Cases  
### Aggregation, Core, Peering and DC Core with RON(Routed Optical Networking)       
![use-case.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/use-case.png)  

**As user applications become more dynamic, differentiated user experiences are required, and network resources need to be optimized in terms of power and real estate. Cisco 8712-MOD-M has been designed to cater to the market requirement for total system bandwidth, port diversity, and MACsec encryption. K100 SiOne is well positioned to cater service edge and service aggregation roels in service provider domain.  

Moreover, Cisco’s [Converged SDN Transport Solution](https://blogs.cisco.com/sp/routed-optical-networking-its-about-the-architecture), is a simplified single layer architecture that delivers efficient network utilization, reduced network complexity, faster time-to-market, automation empowerment, and differentiated service offering. This solutions works by merging IP and Optimal onto a single layer where all the switching is done. Routers are connected with standardized [400G ZR/ZR+/Bright(0dBm) ZR+ coherent pluggable optics](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/cisco8000/Interfaces/710x/b-interfaces-config-guide-cisco8k-r710x/m-zr-zrp-cisco-8000.html). With a single service layer based upon IP, flexible management tools can leverage [telemetry](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/cisco8000/telemetry/710x/configuration/guide/b-telemetry-cg-8000-710x.html) and [model-driven programmability](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/cisco8000/programmability/710x/b-programmability-cg-8000-710x.html) to streamline lifecycle operations.  

### Secure High-speed Data Center/Cloud interconnect and large Regional Hub/Branch router    
![Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 5.08.50 PM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 5.08.50 PM.png)  

Securing the connections of multiple data centers and cloud environments typically involves meeting the highest levels of bandwidth requirements on a smaller number of links. WAN MACsec, sometimes called data center interconnect (DCI), is the ideal encryption solution for such settings.    

Backhauling remote branch sites is critical to the success of many commercial, enterprise, and government organizations. In the consumer space, backhauling is important for remote stores and point-of-sale kiosks. In the government space, it is crucial for the operation of remote agencies and offices.
