## Cisco 8000 Overview   
The Cisco® 8000 Series combines the revolutionary Cisco Silicon One™, IOS XR® software, and clean sheet chassis design to deliver a breakthrough in high-performance routers. The 8000 Series comprises a full range of feature-rich and highly scalable and reliable routers. Cisco 8608 is a part of a new complementary portfolio built on Centralized Architecture based chassis design.  

The Cisco 8608 is a unique platform that combines flexibility and reliability while offering investment protection. Customers can achieve unmatched reliability with redundant control and data plane via redundant route processors and redundant switch cards. Unlike distributed architecture, the forwarding decisions on centralized platforms are centrally performed. Cisco 8608 can also be operated in a non-redundant mode as per the appropriate customer required use case. Cisco 8608 first generation switch cards are powered by [Cisco Silicon One™ Q200 ASIC](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/silicon-one/white-paper-sp-fixed-box-router.pdf). A wide variety of modular port adapters allow for high interface diversity.  

This data sheet is specifically for the Cisco 8608 router. In addition to the centralized router architecture in the Cisco 8608, the Cisco 8000 Series includes two other distinct router architectures that utilize the Cisco Silicon One ASICs:  
  - **Distributed**: The Cisco 8800 Series provides the highest bandwidth via distributed chassis with a redundant control plane and switch fabric. The 8800 Series includes the Cisco 8804, 8808, 8812, and 8818. These chassis deliver up to 28.8 Tbps per line card via 100, 400, and 800G ports.  
  - **Fixed**: The Cisco 8100 and 8200 utilize Cisco’s standalone architecture to deliver full routing functionality with a single ASIC per router. Both support the full routing feature set. The 8200 has deep buffers and expanded forwarding tables, while the 8100 is targeted for routed data center applications with lower buffering and forwarding table scale requirements.  
  
Learn more about Cisco 8000 distributed and fixed portfolio in the [Cisco 8000 data sheet](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/8000-series-routers/datasheet-c78-742571.html).  

## Cisco 8608 Overview   
Large, distributed chassis have traditionally been designed to cater to the market requirement for total system bandwidth, port diversity, and redundancy. The requirements far exceeded what could be accomplished with a single NPU. The fabrics that weave together multi-NPU systems had to be provisioned to the highest bandwidth use case and deployed 100% upfront, consuming power and capital regardless of the number of installed line cards. That wisdom held true for multiple generations of core, edge, and aggregation distributed systems.  

Now with the advent of dense Cisco Silicon One ASICs, we can address these roles with a new breed of centralized architectures that combine the best aspects of distributed and fixed systems.  Cisco 8608 has combined the redundancy and I/O diversity of distributed systems with the economics and simple elegance of fixed platforms. As a result, Cisco 8608 delivers redundancy at an optimized cost while enabling flexibility and expandability through generational continuity.

The Cisco 8608 router is 7 RU in height and less than 600mm in sheet metal depth with 8 slots for three types of MPAs (Modular Port Adapters).  

Supporting the Cisco 8608 router capabilities demanded a wide range of new approaches to platform design. By leveraging decades of high-performance system design, Cisco has delivered unprecedented capacity without compromising forwarding performance. This required new power supplies, a redesigned cooling architecture, and future-proof connectors.  

The Cisco 8608 router required extensive innovation and consolidation of capabilities to greatly increase the power efficiency of the solution. As with all modern networking devices the power density of the ASIC creates challenging thermal conditions. These challenges are addressed via advanced system design, including optimized fans and heat sinks.   

The Cisco 8608 router utilizes a state-of-the-art orthogonal design with advanced cooling via front to back airflow, high power capacity and new power supplies. The chassis and all data path components for the Cisco 8608 router benefit from a clean sheet design that allows the systems to take full advantage of the latest technologies and Cisco’s design expertise. This design connects all forwarding path components directly without a backplane or midplane. In the Cisco 8608 router, the eight Modular Port Adaptors (MPAs) along with the two Route Processors are vertically oriented. Every major component of the Cisco 8608 router was developed with a clean sheet approach – representing unprecedented investment and commitment to a long lifecycle for the Cisco 8608 router.  

Investment Protection – The design of the system keeps in mind the ability to upgrade all the major components of the Chassis (Switch Card, Route Processor &and Modular Port Adaptors). Cisco is investing in the future of the platform for the customers to be able to upgrade to the next generation.  

The key chassis components and their overview is captured in the table below:

### Cisco 8608 value proposition  

**Redundancy** – Cisco 8608 introduces a new forwarding paradigm via a redundant control plane (route processor [RP] redundancy) and redundant data plane (switch card [SC] redundancy). A redundant 8608 requires two RPs and two SCs, while a nonredundant 8608 is comprised of a single RP & SC.  

**Investment Protection** – The design of the system keeps in mind the ability to upgrade all the major components of the Chassis (Switch Card, Route Processor and Modular Port Adaptors). Cisco is investing in the future of the platform for customers to be able to upgrade to the next generation.  

**Flexibility** – Flexibility via MPA modularity and interface diversity. Native port speed support from 10 GbE upto 400 GbE. Wide variety of optics support for multiple customer use cases.

**Cisco 8608 modular port adapters**  
The Cisco 8608 supports three different modular port adapters (MPAs). The details are captured in table below:  

| Modular Port Adapter | Bandwidth | 10/25/50 GbE Physical Ports | 100 GbE Physical Ports | 400 GbE Physical Ports | MACsec | Timing (Roadmap) |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------|------------------|
| 86-MPA-14H2FH-M      | 1.6 Tbps  | -                           | 14                     | 2                      | Yes    | Class B/C        |
| 86-MPA-24Z-M         | 1.2 Tbps  | 24                          | -                      | -                      | Yes    | Class B/C        |
| 86-MPA-4FH-M         | 1.6 Tbps  | -                           | -                      | 4                      | Yes    | Class B/C        |  

**86-MPA-14H2FH-M**   
86-MPA-14H2FH-M can be inserted into any slot (slot 0 to slot 7) of the chassis without any restriction. This MPA is a pluggable card that provides 16 interface ports for a maximum total bandwidth of 1.6 Tbps that can support up to:  

- 16 ports of QSFP 100 GbE modules (Default), or
- 2 ports of QSFP-DD 400 GbE modules and 14 ports of QSFP
When port 0 has a 400G QSFP-DD, then the other three ports (2, 3, 4) cannot be used. Similarly, when port 1 has a 400G QSFP-DD, then the other three ports (5, 6, 7) cannot be used.  

**Note**: No restriction in term of power or cooling for 400G ZR/ZR+/Bright ZR+

### RP (Route Processor)  

The Cisco 8608 route processor (RP) sits vertically in the front of the chassis handling control plane and management plane operations. In addition to other ports, the RP has the timing ports on it.  The RP is not SerDes connected to the Switch Card.    

- Redundant 8608 : There will be two RPs in the system which work in Active-standby mode.   
- Non-Redundant 8608 : There will be a single RP in the system . This kind of a system does not offer any control plane redundancy.   

RPs manage all routing operations on the Cisco 8608 Routers.  

![new RP.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/new RP.png){: .full}    
Figure 10. 8608-RP  
{: .text-center}  


Front panel ports include management and Timing interfaces:  
- RJ45 console port directly connected to CPU  
- 10/100/1000 Mbps Management Ethernet Port  
- USB 3.0 (Type A)  
- Timing ports: 1588 PTP SFP, SyncE, BITS, GNSS PRTC-A, and GPS(ToD with RJ45 port, 1PPS and 10MHz coax input)  

RP contains an Intel 6-core @ 2.5 GHz, 64GB DDR4 DRAM, and 256 GB M.2 SSD Flash Drive.  
This RPs are connected to the midplane and communicate with their devices via PCIE etc.  
  
### SC (Switch Card)  

The Cisco 8608 router Switch Card sits behind the Fan Trays. Cisco 8608 router has two Fan Trays with a total of eight Fan Modules. The Cisco Silicon One Q200 sits within the Switch Card and all the packet process and forwarding decisions are driven by the Switch Card.    

![SC front rear.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/SC front rear.png){: .full}   
Figure 11. 8608-SC0-128  
{: .text-center}  

Cisco 8608 can operate with up to 2 Switch Cards(SCs) between MPA and Fan Trays.  

![2 SC rear.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2 SC rear.png){: .full}    
Figure 12. Redundant SCs in the back of the Cisco 8608  
{: .text-center}  

The RP & SC operate in pairs RP0-SC0 and RP1-SC1 to deliver redundancy without bandwidth loss.    
The two SCs are CPU-less connected to both the RPs via PCIE, P2PM, EOBC links and each SC has one Cisco Silicon One Q200 providing the data path for packet processing and forwarding.    

![redun system.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/redun system.png){: .full}   
Figure 13. Redundant System  
{: .text-center}  

The SC is installed in the rear of the chassis. The 8 Fan Modules are installed into the SCs. If you need to remove or replace the SC, we recommend that you remove the Fan Modules.    

**Note**: To avoid over-heating the system, the service time between when a Switch Card or Fan Spinner  is removed and re-inserted must be under 3 minutes.  
{: .notice}  

If there is only one SC card plugged in, a Fan Spinner card will be required which is essentially a SC blank slot with a Fan Controller and Fan Modules.

![nonRedund.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/nonRedund.png){: .full}  
Figure 14. Non-Redundant System  
{: .text-center}  

Fan Spinner does not provide any data or control plane functionality.  It is a passive card used to connect the midplane to the Fans.  

### Power Modules    

Cisco 8608 can be installed with up to four 3200W AC or 3200W DC power supplies in the chassis. Ensure that all power connection wiring conforms to the rules and regulations in the National Electrical Code (NEC) and local codes.    

**Note**: The Cisco 8608 chassis doesn't support a mix of AC and DC Power Supply Units (PSUs)  
{: .notice}  

AC Power Module (PSU3.2KW-ACPI)  
- The AC power modules are single feed with 3200W capacity at 220V. They also support operation at 110V with half the capacity.  
- AC power modules are rated at 3200W maximum at 230V AC high line input, and 1570W maximum at 115V AC low line input.  
- AC nominal range: 100 to 120V AC and 200 to 240V AC  
- AC full range: 85 to 132V AC and 180 to 264V AC; with extended range to 300V AC  

DC Power Module (PSU3.2KW-DCPI)  
- The DC power modules are dual feed with 3200W capacity at any specified input voltage. DC power modules with single feed at any specified input voltage provide up to 1600W maximum capacity.  
- DC nominal range: -48 to -60V DC  
- DC full range: -40 to -75V DC      

The airflow direction through the Fan Trays and Power Modules on the Cisco 8608 routers are from front to back (port side intake).  

The maximum power available for operations depends on the input power from your power source, the number and output capabilities of power supplies, and the power redundancy mode that you use.     

The following table lists the amount of power available for Cisco 8600 series routers from all available power trays.   

| Total Power Supply | Combined Mode in Watts(No redundancy) | N+1 Redundancy Mode in Watts (with Single Supply Loss) |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1                  | 3,200                                 | -                                                      |
| 2                  | 6,400                                 | 3,200                                                  |
| 3                  | 9,600                                 | 6,400                                                  |
| 4                  | 12,800                                | 9,600                                                  |

For more understanding on Cisco Silicon One Q200 refer to [Cisco Silicon One Q200-Info](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/silicon-one/datasheet-c78-744312.html).  

<b>MPA assignment to Cisco Silicon One Q200 in SC</b>  
Cisco 8608 is straightforward in terms of MPA slot positioning where any of the 8 MPA slots can accommodate any MPA variants. There is no MPA slot restrictions in the chassis.    

There is one Q200 in each Switch Card.    

![New IFG.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/New IFG.png){: .full}    
Figure 19. Cisco 8608 MPA assignment to Q200         
{: .text-center}  

Each SC is connected to MPA 0 to MPA 7. Maximum MPA bandwidth to Q200 is 1.6 Tbps. And so a total of 12.8 Tbps duplex per Cisco 8608 system.  

There is a Cisco 8608 with the MPA in slot 1(86-MPA-14H2FH-M) and slot 2(86-MPA-4FH-M). Let’s concentrate on slot 2 for this example.

This MPA does not have a CPU and is managed by the RP. This each PHY can support the multi-rate Ethernet PHY that provides the capacity and feature integration required to enable MACsec functionality.  
86-MPA-14H2FH-M can support several interface combinations.    

The first of the combo configurations is 16x100 GbE QSFP, in this configuration the QSFPDD ports are populated with 100G optics not 400G, the QSFP28 ports are populated with 100G optics. This is the default mode(without manual configuration).  
![combo1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/combo1.png){: .full}    

The second of the combo configuration is 2x 400G QSFPDD + 8x 100G QSFP, in this configuration the QSFPDD ports are populated with 400G optics.    

Changing Port 0 or Port 1 individually to 400G mode automatically disables Port 2/3/4 or Port 5/6/7.      

The ports that are available in the 2x 400G QSFPDD + 8x 100G QSFP Combo mode are Ports 0/1/8~15 as shown in the figures below. The faceplate will have markings to reflect this.    
![combo2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/combo2.png){: .full}   

The third of the combo configuration is 10/25G breakout solution.
4x 10G or 4x 25G breakout will not be supported on Port 0 to 9 (PHY 0 & 1). Only on PHY 2’s port 10, 12, and 14 and disabled Port 11, 13, and 15.

## Redundancy Details  
Within the system even though RP0, RP1, SC0, SC1 are 4 different cards, from redundancy standpoint system software would consider RP0-SC0 together as Active Pair and RP1-SC1 as Standby Pair.  

There’s supported and unsupported configuration in Cisco 8608.  

| System Type   | Supported System configuration | Unsupported System configuration |
|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Redundant     | RP0-SC0, RP1-SC1               | RP0-SC1                          |
|               |                                | RP1-SC0                          |
|               |                                | RP0-SC0, RP1 without SC1         |
|               |                                | RP1-SC1, RP0 without SC0         |
|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Non-Redundant | RP0-SC0, FS1 without RP1       | RP1-SC1                          |
|               |                                | RP1-SC0                          |
|               |                                | RP0-SC1                          |  

For Redundant 8608, user can use “8608-SYS-R” PID in the order tool. System is shipped with two RPs, two SCs.      
For Non-Redundant 8608 configuration, user can use “8608-SYS-NR” PID. 8608 system is shipped with only one RP, one SC, one FS.  
 
Let’s discuss with the default state when system boots up under redundant system.  
 RP0-SC0 together as one Domain 0(Active Pair) and RP1-SC1 as the other Domain 1(Standby Pair).

In this default scenario, RP0 gains mastership and RP1 is in Backup state.
Both SC0 and SC1 are packet processing and forwarding capability.  

Active/Standby Domain pair can be verified using “show platform domain” CLI.

If Active RP0 encounters a fatal fault or is removed, Standby RP immediately gains mastership via HW arbitration mechanism. MPAs switchover data path to RP1-SC1.
